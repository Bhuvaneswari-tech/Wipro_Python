Challenge 2: Employee Payroll Bonus Script
Scenario:
An HR department wants to calculate an employee’s final salary after tax and bonus, 
check bonus eligibility, and verify attendance record bits.

Requirements & Logic:
Input & Initialization:
Base_Salary = 60000.0
Tax_Percent = 10
Attendance_Flags = 6 (binary 110)

Arithmetic & Casting:
Net_Salary = Base_Salary - (Base_Salary * Tax_Percent / 100)
Apply a 5% loyalty bonus → Bonus_Salary = Net_Salary * 1.05
Truncate to integer → Final_Salary_Int

Logical & Bitwise Operations:
Eligible_for_Bonus = Base_Salary > 50000 and True 
Perfect_Attendance = (Attendance_Flags & 2) != 0


Output:
Print final salary, bonus eligibility, attendance flag.
