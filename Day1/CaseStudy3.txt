Challenge 1: Smart Utility Billing System
Scenario:
You are developing a billing script for a power company. 
The program should calculate the total bill after applying a 
usage surcharge, check for high-consumption customers, and verify 
service alert flags using bitwise operations.

Requirements & Logic:
Input & Initialization:
Base_Units = 350
Rate_Per_Unit = 5.75
Service_Flags = 9 (binary 1001 → multiple conditions)

Arithmetic and Casting:
Total_Cost = Base_Units * Rate_Per_Unit
If Base_Units > 300, apply 10% surcharge → Total_Cost *= 1.10
Convert final float to integer (truncate) → Final_Bill_Int

Logical & Bitwise Operations:
is_High_Usage = Base_Units > 300
Service_Alert = (Service_Flags & 1) != 0

Output:
Print total cost, final bill, usage status, and service alert.
